## Methodology

### General Requirements

- CSS Preprocessor (SCSS)
- JavaScript used for Dom Manipulation
- JavaScript events are used
- JavaScript objects to store and access data
- Proper webpack configuration
- Semantic HTML Tag
- CSS Box Model
- CSS FlexBox
- Device Adaptability
- Github pages for deployment

### Specific Requirements

- Set up a new project with webpack.
- Create an index.html file and write your HTML markup here. 
- Create an empty To Do List placeholder (<ul> element). 
- The index.html file is set as a template using the HTML Webpack Plugin.
- Remove all hardcoded items from the tasks array
- A new javascript file created for the new functionality
- A function is implemented for adding a new task
- A function is implemented for deleting a task

- Incase of deletion the order of the index is shifted and rearranged
- Add a new JavaScript file and import it as a module:
- Add event listener to the checkbox (change).
- Update items object's value for completed key upon user actions.
- Implement a function for the "Clear all completed" button (use filter() method).
- Store the updated array of items in local storage, so the user gets the correct list values after the page reloads.
- Changes are saved to local storage
- Each task object contain three keys:
  - description [string].
  - completed [bool].
  - index: [number].
- Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
- On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. 
- The list is appear in order of the index values for each task.
- Create a main.scss and set rules for the To Do List.
